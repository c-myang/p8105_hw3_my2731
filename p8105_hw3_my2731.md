## Problem 1: Instacart Data

We will be working with the “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping
Dataset 2017”.

### Data overview and description

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart
```

    ## # … with 1,384,607 more rows, 6 more variables: days_since_prior_order <int>,
    ## #   product_name <chr>, aisle_id <int>, department_id <int>, aisle <chr>,
    ## #   department <chr>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​add_to_cart_order,
    ## #   ²​reordered, ³​eval_set, ⁴​order_number, ⁵​order_dow, ⁶​order_hour_of_day

The dataset contains information about online grocery orders made
through Instacart. There 1,384,617 observations of 15 variables, where
each row in the dataset is a product from an order. Each order is
associated with a unique order ID number and order ID. The variables
`order_hour_of_day` and `order_dow` describe the time (hour of day and
day of the week) orders were made. Each row also contains information
about each product, such as `product_name`, `aisle`, and `department` of
the product. The variable `reordered` indicates whether a product has
been purchased by a user in the past, and `add_to_cart_order` indicates
the order an item was placed in the cart.

For example, for `order_id == 1`, we can see the order was made at 10AM
on a Thursday, 4 out of the 8 products are reorders, and that most of
the products came from the produce and dairy eggs department.

## Data exploration

Now, we want to conduct some basic EDA and answer some questions about
the `instacart` data.

1.  Number of aisles

Using `group_by`, and `summarise`, we can determine the number of
aisles, and the most popular aisles customers order from in the dataset.

``` r
aisles = instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_obs = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs))

aisles
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 3
    ## # Groups:   aisle_id [134]
    ##    aisle_id aisle                          n_obs
    ##       <int> <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1       83 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2       24 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3      123 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4      120 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5       21 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6      115 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7       84 milk                           32644
    ##  8      107 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9       91 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10      112 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

There are 134 different aisles. The most popular aisles customers order
from are fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and packaged vegetables fruits,
respectively.

2.  Plotting number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
plot_aisles = aisles %>% 
  filter(n_obs >= 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, n_obs), y = n_obs)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Instacart items ordered by aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of items ordered",
    caption = "Data from The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 in the p8105.datasets package"
  )

plot_aisles
```

![](p8105_hw3_my2731_files/figure-gfm/plot_aisles-1.png)<!-- -->

Through the bar plot, we can confirm that for aisles with over 10,000
items ordered, the most popular aisles are fresh fruits and vegetables,
and the least popular aisles are butter, oils and vinegars, and dry
pasta.

3.  Popular items

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
pop_items = instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarise(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs),.by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  slice(1)

knitr::kable(pop_items)
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                    | n_obs |
|:---------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|------:|
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                               |   157 |
| dog food care              | Organix Grain Free Chicken & Vegetable Dog Food |    14 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                            |  3324 |

4.  Mean ordering times

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
