The dataset contains information about online grocery orders made
through Instacart. There 1,384,617 observations of 15 variables, where
each row in the dataset is a product from an order. Each order is
associated with a unique order ID number and order ID. The variables
`order_hour_of_day` and `order_dow` describe the time (hour of day and
day of the week) orders were made. Each row also contains information
about each product, such as `product_name`, `aisle`, and `department` of
the product. The variable `reordered` indicates whether a product has
been purchased by a user in the past, and `add_to_cart_order` indicates
the order an item was placed in the cart.

For example, for `order_id == 1`, we can see the order was made at 10AM
on a Thursday, 4/8 products are reorders, and that most of the products
came from the produce and dairy eggs department.
